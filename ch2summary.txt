Answer: "Do first babies arrive late?"

    Pregnancy is a time of hope and excitement for couples and families, but it comes with no shortage of anxiety. One concern many have is over the differences in birth time between a first child as opposed to a second, third or other, later child. Many have the question of whether first babies arrive late.

    The answer that first babies are in fact more likely to be late, but not by any amount of time significant to the child's health. First babies are 65% more likely to be late than other births, but the overall difference between the two groups is only 0.54 days.
